### Research interests

<ol reversed>
  <li><strong>The Heat Kernel Estimate on the Asymptotically Hyperbolic Manifolds and the Stability of the Asymptotically Hyperbolic Einstein Manifolds</strong> (joint with Jie Qing) </li> <a href="https://universe1991.github.io/yufeishan.github.io/assets/The_asymptotically_hyperbolic_manifolds_and_the_heat_kernel_estimate.pdf">More details</a>
    <ul> 
     <li> Studied the relations between the heat kernel of Lichnerowicz Laplacian and the long time existence and the convergence of the Ricci flow based on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.4267.pdf">result of R.Bamler </a>.</li>
     <li> Studied the relations between the heat kernel of Lichnerowicz Laplacian and the resolvent of Lichnerowicz Laplacian (This is a direct corollary of the spectrum theorem) and tried to get the estimate of the heat kernel of Lichnerowicz Laplacian by the corresponding Schwartz kernel of that. By the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06044.pdf">work of X.Chen and A.Hassell</a>, in order to get a good estimate of the heat kernel of of Lichnerowicz Laplacian, we need a tensor version result of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.3507.pdf">R.B.Melrose, A.S.Barreto and A.Vasy</a>. </li> 
     <li> Trying to generalized the result of R.B.Melrose, A.S.Barreto, A.Vasy about the Schwartz kernel estimate from the Laplacian operator on the function to the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on the symmetric two tensor. </li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>The Perturbation Existence and the stability of Conformally Compact Einstein Manifolds under the Ricci flow</strong> (joint with Jie Qing) <a href="https://universe1991.github.io/yufeishan.github.io/assets/Normalized_Ricci_flow_and_conformally_compact_Einstein_manifolds.pdf">(A draft of my paper about this result)</a> </li> 
   <ul>
    <li>Recovered <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0105046.pdf">J. Lee's result (See the Theorem A)</a> about the perturbation Existence of the conformally compact Einstein manifolds by the Ricci flow</li>
    <li>Improved <a href="ttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.0372.pdf">the result of J.Qing, Y.Shi and J.Wu (See Theorem 1.3)</a> about the stability of conformally compact Einstein manifolds. </li>
   </ul>
