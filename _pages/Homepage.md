### *Yufei Shan (单宇飞)*

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the supervised by Professor [Fang Wang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/teachershow/tags/MDAwMDAwMDAwMLKIfpg). <br>

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California, Santa Cruz, advised by Distinguished Professor [Jie Qing](https://qing.sites.ucsc.edu). Before my doctoral career, I received my master degree at [School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China](http://math.ustc.edu.cn/ENGLISH/list.htm) under the advice of [Zuoqing Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~wangzuoq/).<br>

My research interests: <br>
> - Conformal and CR Geometry: Investigating the interplay between boundary geometry (conformal or CR) and interior Riemannian geometry in conformally compact Einstein and asymptotically complex hyperbolic Einstein manifolds, with applications to the holographic principle.
> - Semiclassical Analysis: Developing precise heat kernel estimates on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds using semiclassical methods.
