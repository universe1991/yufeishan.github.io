### *Hi! This is Yufei Shan (单宇飞),<br> a PhD candidate in mathematics at<br> University of California, Santa Cruz.*

With 5-year math PhD career, I have built a solid foundation in mathematics and a strong ability of 
the problem solving and analysis. Meanwhile, I am proficient with different programming language and different tools/frameworks such as Java, Python, Spring, React, Node.js and TensorFlow. I am also familiar with various kinds of Machine learning model such as SVM, polynomial regression, Reinforcement learning, Deep learning, CNN. I like challenging competitive problems and hope to work with different background guys to solve these problems.

My research interests: geometric analysis, conformal geometry, CR-geometry, symmetric spaces, microlocal analysis, semiclassical microlocal analysis, representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras, etc. 

At present, my research focuses on the stability of the asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein manifolds under Ricci flow under the advice of [Jie Qing](https://qing.sites.ucsc.edu). 

Before moving to UCSC, I received my master degree at [School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China](http://math.ustc.edu.cn/ENGLISH/list.htm) under the advice of [Zuoqing Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~wangzuoq/).
